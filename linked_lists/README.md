- Is a form of a sequential collection and it does not have to be in order. 
- It is made up of independent nodes that may contain any type of data and each node has a reference to the next node in the link 

The perfect example is a train with carts, each cart is independent and the carts contain the passengers/goods and the links 

Types of Linked lists 
- Single linked list 
- Circular linked lists 
- Doubly linked lists 
- Circular doubly linked lists 

1. Singly linked lists 
- Each node contains a value and a ref to the next node in the linked list except the last node i.e the tail
2. Circular singly linked list. 
- Each node has  data and ref to the next node but last node has ref to the first node 
3. Doubly linked list 
- Each node has data and 2 references. The reference to the previous node and the ref to the next node. 
- For head, the prev will always be null and for the last node the next will always be null. 
4. Circular doubly linked lists
- Each node has data and 2 references. The last node has the ref to the 1st node and the first node has the ref to the last node as the previous
